* Answering all of the questions on the Google drive link.
* Make a detailed plan of what to do
* Adding and debugging 3 first functions
* There were no bugs during the coding, since I tested each function separately in the scratch work file to make sure each function works properly

Wednesday, October 23, 2019
* Completed the project 
* There were no bugs during the code, since I tested the functions separately (with inputs) in the scratch work files
* Adding readme 

#### USING THE FORMAT OF README IN PROJECT A05 TO WRITE THE REFLECTION AND SUMMARY FOR PROJECT A06

## INITIAL DESIGN PLAN:

Summarize a plan which meets the computational requirements to solve the problem. Your plan does not need to be syntactically correct. It needs to capture the flow of logic in a human readable format.
1. Function computer_choice(): prints the computer's choice.
2. Function check_user_choice():  checks to see if the user's input is compatible for this game or not.
    If the user puts in an incompatible word, require the user to redo it until it is compatible.
3. Function  check_winner(): check to see the user wins or loses
4. Function points(): calculates the points of each round 
5. Function sum(): sums the score of the game

## IMPLEMENTATIONS:

A list in bullet form of each function you created, and what is each functionâ€™s purpose.
* Function computer_choice()
* Function check_user_choice()
* Function check_winner()
* Function points()
* Function sum()


## TESTING:

1. Test each function separately in the Scratch work file 
2. Test all functions again and again

## ERRORS:

A list in bullet form of all known errors and deficiencies in your implementation.
* No error

## SUMMARY:

A brief summary description of the design and implementation, including how much your initial design plan evolved, the final result you achieved, and the amount of time you spent as a programmer in accomplishing these results. This should be no more than two paragraphs. Consider this like a report of what you did.


This program is easy and interesting, as it resembles the game I always played as a kid. 

## COMMENTS:

A paragraph or so of your own comments on and reactions to this assignment. Consider this like a reflection.

I like this assignment. The reason is that I can try to use more tuples, instead of list in order to save the space for the program.
I also try not to use variable at the global scope, by creating a list in the main() function.
